# About
This is a Mini-Project Assignment for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). This project uses data from Kaggle, UCI Heart Disease Data published by MD. REDWAN KARIM SONY (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data)

## Problem Definition
- Based On Symptoms Exhibited By The Patients Are We Able To Predict If They Have Heart Disease?

## Models Used
1. Binary Classification - Linear Regression
2. Random Forest + Random Forest Hyperparameter Tuning Using RandomizedSearchCV & GridSearchCV
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Decision Tree

## Data Insights From Exploratory Data Analysis
- Numerical Data : Age, rest_blood_pressure, cholesterol_level , max_heart_rate
-- Age & Max Heart Rate Could Have A Relationship With The Presence Of Heart Disease <br>
- Categorical Data : diabetic, resting_ecg, sex, exercise_angina, chest_pain
-- Type Of Chest Pain, Exercise Angina, Sex Could Have A Relationship With The Presence Of Heart Disease

## Conclusion From Machine Learning
- We Are Able To Predict The Presence Of Heart Disease Using Binary Classification Which Has The Highest Accuracy Out Of The Different Models Used 73 % Of The Time.
- This Model Has A 76% True Positive Rate (TPR) , A False Negative Rate Of 24%, A 45% False Positive Rate (FPR).
- By Creating A Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve, We Are Able To Visualise The Trade-Off Between TPR and FPR.
- The Area Under The Curve, Representing This RelationShip Has A Value Of 0.70. Comparing This Value To The Value Of 0.5, We Are Able To Predict The Presence Of Heart Disease At A Much Better Rate Than Simply Guessing At Random.
- Exercise Angina, Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol and Max Heart Rate Plays A Large Role In Predicting Heart Disease.
> Although The Models Prediction Accuracy Not Be Extremely High, We Are Able To Minimally Detect A High Possibility Of The Presence Of Heart Diseease. If A Person Is Speculated To Have Heart Disease Using This Model, They Should Be Examined Early In Order To Receive Early Treatment.

## Data Insights From Machine Learning
- Exercise Angina, Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol And Heart Rate Play A Big Part In Predicting Heart Disease.
- Resting Max Heart Rate, ECG, Chest Pain, and Gender Play A Low Part In Predicting Heart Disease
- People With Chest Pain Of Type Non-Anginal or Atypical Angina With Age Lesser Than 56 And Blood Pressure Lesser Than 191 Generally Have No Heart Conditions.
- Patients With Chest Pain: Typical Angina Or Asymptomatic With Exercise Induced Angina And Normal Or Lv Hypertrophy Resting ECG generally Have Heart Disease.
  
## What did we learn?
1. Binary Classification - Linear Regression Is A Good Model Used To Predict Binary Values (True or False)
2. Random Forest - A Better Model As Compared To Decision Tree Which Also Addresses Over-Fitting Problem
3. HyperParameter Tuning - We Learnt How We Can Effectively Tune Our Model Parameters For Optimal Results
4. Binary Predictions Usage Of False Negative Rate For Binary Prediction Instead Of Just True Positive Rate & False Positive Rate
